## Secure Web Application Development for Telecommunication Server

This project focused on securing a telecommunication server's web application by addressing critical vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices.

### Key Security Enhancements

- **SQL Injection Mitigation (CWE-89):**
  - Identified and mitigated SQL injection risks by implementing parameterized queries and robust input validation.
  - These measures effectively safeguarded the application from unauthorized data access and manipulation.

- **Code Tampering Prevention (CWE-494):**
  - Utilized input sanitization and SHA-256 hashing to prevent code tampering.
  - Ensured that sensitive data remained secure, reinforcing the application's integrity against malicious threats.
